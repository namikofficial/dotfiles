# OpenCode workflow configuration

The canonical configuration is `opencode.local-llamacpp.json` and is linked to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` by the existing setup scripts.

Useful commands:

```sh
scripts/opencode-capabilities.sh
scripts/opencode-permission show
scripts/opencode-permission normal
scripts/opencode-permission auto
scripts/verify /path/to/project affected
scripts/verify /path/to/project full
setup/install-verify-adapters.sh       # dry run
setup/install-verify-adapters.sh --apply
```

The phase commands are available inside OpenCode as `/research`, `/plan`, `/build`, `/verify`, `/permission`, and `/handoff`, alongside the existing `/goal` and `/full-fix` commands. Runtime phase artifacts live in a project-local, gitignored `.ai/` directory.

Optional Bruno, Schemathesis, axe, Roborazzi, browser CLI, cloud-device, and physical-device checks are capability-gated. They are never silently installed or reported as passing when unavailable.
